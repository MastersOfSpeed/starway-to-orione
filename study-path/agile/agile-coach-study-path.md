This study path has been organized and divided into the following **_competence areas_** of an agile coach:

* Agile Coach Explained
* Lean and Agile Practitioner
* Teaching
* Facilitation
* Transformation
* Pure Coaching
* Business

Moreover, to ease the creation of personal and customized study paths, we divided the **_competence areas_** in modules, from zero to hero.    
That way, students will be able to create their own study path mixing self assessment and proposed modules.

Regardless of the competence area: [Workbook per Agile Coach](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByysWdfTp_ZGZjdFS0lya09LY0U/view?usp=sharing).
